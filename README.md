## 👋 Hi, here is a little bit about me:)

I'm Jaward Sesay, a CS grad student at Beijing Institute of Technology specializing in AI/ML research, with focus on Autonomous Agents and Large Language Models. I am also a Research member of the Open Science Community at Cohere Labs. Earlier in my AI journey, I had the honour of co-authoring my first paper (**[AutoAgents](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/0003.pdf)**) with mentors and leading researchers, this paper was later accepted at **IJCAI 2024**. I am a devoted open-source/open-science contributor with projects that the open-source community finds helpful (**[GitHub](https://github.com/Jaykef/ai-algorithms)** | **[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Jaward)**). Currently, I'm building my first AI startup **[Lectūra Labs](https://lecturalabs.com/)** — an AI+Education lab focused on research and development of AI-native tools and models that empower individual learners to master needed self-taught skills. My AI journey began after watching **[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)**'s ["Neural Networks - Zero to Hero"](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) series — he has been my role-model/sensei ever since. I weekly practice implementing groundbreaking AI papers & algorithms from first principles, often under compute constrained conditions (i.e gpu poor, training nns on 8gb cpu), you can checkout the repo here: [nanoAI Algorithms](https://github.com/Jaykef/ai-algorithms). I often post about my work on [Twitter](https://x.com/JawardSesay_) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Jaward), stay in touch.
